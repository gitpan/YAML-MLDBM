YAML::MLDBM version 0.10
========================

NEW FEATURES

- Maiden voyage

INTRO

This module is similar to MLDBM except that it stores data internally as
YAML, instead of Data::Dumper or Storable. By doing this, you can create
tied hash DBM databases that can be used seamlessly in Python or Ruby
applications. That's because those languages also have YAML and DBM
modules. As other languages get YAML support, you should be able to use
YAML::MLDBM with them as well.

USAGE

    use YAML::MLDBM;

    my $h = YAML::MLDBM->new('./my_dbm_file');

    $h->{'@INC'} = \@INC;
    $h->{'%ENV'} = \%ENV;

    use Data::Dumper;
    print Dumper $h;

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
